<h2> "{{ book.name }}" Description:</h2>
<p> All the Light We Cannot See is a 2014 war novel by American author Anthony Doerr. The novel is set during World War II and centers around the characters Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl who takes refuge in her uncle's house in Saint-Malo after Paris is invaded by Nazi Germany, and Werner Pfennig, a bright German boy who is accepted into a military school because of his skills in radio technology, before being sent to the military. The novel is written in a lyrical style, and almost all of the chapters alternate between Marie-Laure's and Werner's stories, which parallel each other. The narrative has a nonlinear structure, flashing between the Battle of Saint-Malo and the events leading up to it. The story has ethical themes such as the dangers of greed and the nature of sacrifice, and portrays the destructive nature of war and Doerr's fascination with science and nature. </p>
